This project is a Windows Forms application designed to estimate the growth of 
an investment over time based on user input. The application calculates the future 
value of an investment with a yearly contribution, growth rate, and investment goal.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical example of how C# can be 
used to create a financial planning tool. The application demonstrates the calculation
of compound interest and displays the results in a separate form for user convenience.
